    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        It's soup. Made with onions. It's pretty good, I think.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Onions, obviously, you should probably peel and cut them first</li>
        <li>Beef stock, ideally make your own, recipe not provided</li>
        <li>Wine</li>
        <li>Gruyere, or whatever cheese you got</li>
        <li>Croutons, or you could make your own if you feel like it, recipe not provided</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Whatever other herbs or spices you feel like putting in</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Caramelize onions. Go slow. Don't burn them.</li>
        <li>Did you manage not to burn them? If so, good job, feel free to drink the wine as a reward. It's not actually used in this recipe. If you did burn them, start over and feel free to drink the wine to deal with your failure.</li>
        <li>Add beef stock.</li>
        <li>Simmer it for a while. It's soup, it's hard to mess up.</li>
        <li>Add salt to taste. I'm not your boss, add as much as you want.</li>
        <li>Pour it into some crocks or ramekins or something if you're fancy, or whatever kind of bowls you can safely put in the oven.</li>
        <li>Add croutons and cheese on top, put it under the broiler.</li>
        <li>Don't burn yourself eating it.</li>
    </ol>
